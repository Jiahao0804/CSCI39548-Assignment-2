This repository is the starter code for Assignment 2 - JavaScript Methods.
<br>

JavaScript Prototype: Method
<br>
Every object in JavaScript has a built-in property called "prototype."
<br>
The prototype constructor is used to add new methods (functions) and properties to a JavaScript object.
<br>
If a method is constructed, then it will be available for the object.
<br>
If a property is constructed, then the object will be given the property and its value, as default.
<br>
In this assignment, we use the prototype constructor to add new methods to the Array() object.

1. Use the following process to import the Assignment 2 starter code repository to your GitHub account as the starter codebase
1) Log on to GitHub
2) Click on the + sign in the top right corner (next to the user icon)
3) In the dropdown menu, select "Import repository"
4) A new page will open
5) In "Your old repository’s clone URL" field, enter: https://github.com/johnnylaicode/grid-maker-starter-code
6) In "Your new repository details" field, enter your own repository name (e.g., "assignment-2")
7) Click on the "Begin import" button to start the process
8) After the process completed, your new "assignment-2" repository is created – as a completely independent codebase
9) From this point on, you can clone your new repository, make changes, create feature branches, and create/merge pull requests

2. Use the information below to clone the starter codebase to your local machine
After creating the starter codebase "assignment-2" repository on GitHub (see above), you can clone it to your local machine. The instructions on how to clone a GitHub repository are available at this link.
